# pageobject-helper
Project which will house all of the Page Objects that I use in my automation example projects. This way I will have a centralized repo where any change I make will be consumed across all other projects.

This package is currently published publically at NPM and can be used by running `npm install @devynngrey/pageobject-helper`
